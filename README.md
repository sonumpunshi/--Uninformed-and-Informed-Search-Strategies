Input Specification: The agent accepts command line arguments specifying the start state, goal state, search method, and a flag for dumping the search trace.

Search Strategies: Implemented a variety of search strategies, including BFS, UCS, DFS, DLS, IDS, Greedy, and A* Search. Designed an acceptable heuristic for the Greedy and A* Search methods. 

Search Trace: Optionally dumped the search trace for analysis, including the fringe and closed set contents per search loop, counts of nodes expanded and generated, and other relevant information.

Output Format: Displayed the results of the search, including the number of nodes popped, expanded, and generated, the maximum fringe size, solution depth, solution cost, and the list of steps to reach the goal state.
